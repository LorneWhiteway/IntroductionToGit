\begin{frame}{Purpose of presentation}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{I don't want to teach you how to use git.}
      \item{Rather I want to illustrate (part of) git's `internal model' and to define certain key git terminology so that you will be better prepared to teach yourself git.}
      \item{My examples assume you are calling git from the command-line. Friendlier interfaces to git exist - but you still need to know the underlying model to use them effectively.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{git isn't perfect}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{The internal model is complicated.}
      \item{The interface is inconsistent.}
      \item{The documentation is suboptimal.}
      \item{Several key ideas have been given misleading names.}
      \item{It uses a `distributed' model whereas often what you want is a `client/server' model; you may end up `fighting the paradigm'.}
      \item{See more at \url{https://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/}.}

\begin{frame}{Source control}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Source control is software to `keep track of' (i.e. store) successive versions as we edit a collection of \textit{source} files (computer code, \LaTeX{} documents, HTML files, etc.)}
      \item{More efficient on source files that are text, not binary. Intermediate files are usually not kept track of. Output files might be - it's your choice.}
      \item{Any serious project should be under source control.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Source control...}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{... is insurance: there is a small daily cost to having it, but occasionally it provides a massive benefit.}
      \item{... protects you against damage to your files (e.g. hard drive failure, fire, flood, misplacement, accidental deletion, theft, virus, ransomware, file damage due to OS bugs, ...).}
      \item{... protects you against edits to your files that you later regret, as you can revert to an old version. This makes it easier to experiment (as changes can be undone).}
      \item{... allows multiple people to work simultaneously on the same files (as their various changes can be merged).}
      \item{... allows auditing and blaming (as it can identify the author of a given change).}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Working directory and repository}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{You need a \textit{working directory} and a \textit{repository}.}
      \item{The working directory and its subdirectories contain the actual files that you are editing.}
      \item{The repository is some sort of database containing all previous versions.}
      \item{One model would be to put the repository on the Internet or Intranet where all developers can see it...}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Location of git repository}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{... But in git the repository is \textbf{next to} the working directory, in a hidden subdirectory (called .git) of the top-level working directory.}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{ls_output.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{This repository location isn't ideal...}
  \begin{block}{}
    Having the git repository next to your working directory isn't ideal:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{No protection against physical damage to the disk.}
      \item{Others can't see your repository (bad for collaboration).}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{1cm}
    One upside is that you can still do source control even if you are not connected to the Internet.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{So you usually need two git repositories}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{So typically you will also need \textbf{another} git repository on the Internet (for backup, for collaboration and sharing, and to act as a reference version).}
      \item{So you will typically be dealing with \textbf{two} git repositories (and dealing with the issues of keeping them in synch).}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Example repository content}
  \begin{figure}

        \node (C) at (2.5,5) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {C};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (B.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (B.east) -- (C.west) node [midway,left] {};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{This repository contains three successive versions of the files in the working directory (and its subdirectories).}
      \item{Each version is represented here as a \textit{node} (in green).}
      \item{An initial set of files (version A) was comitted to the repository; the files were then edited and the new file set (version B) was comitted; the files were then edited and comitted a third time (version C).}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Another example}
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\ttfamily]
        \node (A) at (-1.25,5) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {A};
        \node (B) at (1.25,6) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {B};
        \node (C) at (1.5,4) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {C};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (B.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (C.west) node [midway,left] {};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Here we committed A...}
      \item{Then we edited A (to form B) and committed B...}
      \item{Then we went back to A, made a perhaps different set of edits (to form C) and committed C.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What do the arrows actually stand for?}
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\ttfamily]
        \node (A) at (-1.25,5) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {A};
        \node (B) at (1.25,6) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {B};
        \node (C) at (1.5,4) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {C};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (B.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (C.west) node [midway,left] {};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{An arrow respects time (pointing from an earlier version to a later version), and indicates that a node was derived from an earlier node by editing.}
      \item{Q: There exists a set of edits that would take you from B to C, so why not show that arrow as well? A: It's a historical record of the route we actually took, not a map of all possible routes.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Merging}
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\ttfamily]
        \node (A) at (-3,5) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {A};
        \node (B) at (-0.125,6) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {B};
        \node (C) at (0.125,4) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {C};
        \node (D) at (3,5) [rectangle, draw,minimum height=1cm, minimum width=1cm, align=center, fill=YellowGreen] {D};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (B.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (A.east) -- (C.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (B.east) -- (D.west) node [midway,left] {};
        \draw [->,thick] (C.east) -- (D.west) node [midway,left] {};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Here we combined the `A to B' edits and the `A to C' edits (to form D), which was committed.}
      \item{More on such \textit{merging} later.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{DAG}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Hence we get a graph (in the mathematical sense of `nodes plus edges').}
      \item{The graph is not a \textit{tree} (because of merging).}
      \item{It is \textit{directed} (edges have arrows) and \textit{acyclic} (cycles would break causality), so we have a \textit{DAG} (directed acyclic graph).}
      \item{Nodes can have \textit{parents} and \textit{children}, and hence \textit{ancestors} and \textit{descendents}.}
      \item{One node - the initial \textit{root} node - has no parents. All other nodes have one or two parents (or more in special cases). Thus the graph is connected, and any two nodes have ancestors in common.}
      \item{\textit{Graph theory} is an interesting part of mathematics - but alas not useful here.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Seeing the DAG}
  \begin{block}{}
  Run \code{gitk --all} to see the DAG (and much other information).
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{DAG.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What's in a node?}
  \begin{block}{}
    At least:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Enough information to reconstruct the working directory as it was at the time of that commit.}
      \item{Administrative information: who made the commit, a `commit message', etc.}
      \item{A permanent node name (SHA1 format - 40 hex digits e.g. c2d2ea34cec13a0956488f2b919861fccad8a448). You can abbreviate this to an initial substring (provided that it is long enough to be unique).}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - tags}
  \begin{block}{}
    A \textit{tag} is a label that is attached to a node; gitk shows them in yellow:
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tag.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
  
\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - branches (1)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{A \textit{branch} is a moveable label that is attached to a node; gitk shows them in green.}
      \item{`Moveable' means that if you commit an edit to that node then the branch label moves to the child node.}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{5mm}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Branch_1.png}%
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Branch_2.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
  
\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - branches (2)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Because it moves with the commits, the branch is often thought of as a `development line' (imagine not just the node that the branch points to, but also all the past and future nodes that the branch has pointed to or will point to).}
      \item{In some contexts (e.g. cloning) a branch is used to refer not only to the pointed-to node but also all its ancestors.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - branches (3)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{A branch can point to any node in the DAG - not just to a terminal node (= node with no descendents).}
      \item{So `branch' is not a perfect metaphor; better is `pointer to a place where growth may occur' (which may be on the trunk).}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Branch_3.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - branches (4)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{When git creates a new repository it creates a branch - by default called `main' - that points to the root node.}
      \item{House rules often insist that the node pointed to by `main' be `good' (i.e. stable, tested, usable); development is then done in other branches that are merged into main following testing and agreement.}
      \item{But this is not forced by git. You don't even need to have a `main' branch.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - HEAD (1)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{The special pointer HEAD points to the node that corresponds to the files in the working directory. This can be any node in the DAG.}
      \item{ Use \code{git checkout <nodename>} to set where HEAD points.}
      \item{In gitk the HEAD node is shown in yellow.}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Head.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pointers to nodes - HEAD (2) - Detached HEAD}
  \begin{block}{}
     Usually HEAD points to the same node as one of the branches. But it doesn't have to; if it doesn't then we say we have a `detached HEAD'.
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{DetachedHead.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Name that node}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Refer to a node using its (abbreviated) SHA1 name e.g. `c2d2ea34'.}
      \item{Or use a pointer name (a tag name, a branch name, or the name `HEAD').}
      \item{Can append \^{} to mean `parent of', \^{}\^{} to mean `grandparent', etc.}
      \item{Example: \code{git checkout main\^{}\^{}}.}
      \item{Distinguish multiple parents via \^{}1 or \^{}2.}
      \item{Alternatively e.g. \textasciitilde4 means the same as \^{}\^{}\^{}\^{}.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DAG manipulation}
  \begin{block}{}
      Much (but not all) of your interaction with a git repository involves maintaining and amending the DAG and the pointers to nodes in the DAG.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The index}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{In addition to the DAG, a git repository also contains an \textit{index}: a list of the files in the working directory that git knows about (i.e. that git is `tracking').}
      \item{The index contains other information that makes it fast to answer the question `has this file changed since a version of it was last put into the repository?'}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Index.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{.gitignore}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{\code{git status} will warn you about files that \textbf{are} in the working directory but \textbf{aren't} in the index (so that git isn't paying attention to them).}
      \item{This gets boring for intermediate files that you never want git to track. So you can list such `files always to be ignored by git' in a special file called .gitignore.
    {\begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{gitignore.png}
   \end{center}}}
      \item{You probably want .gitignore to be one of the files that git is tracking.}
    \end{itemize}
    %\begin{center}
     % \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{gitignore.png}
    %\end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So three possibilities...}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{The index lists the files that git is tracking. (Use \code{git ls-files --stage} to view the index and \code{git add <filename>} to add a file to the index.)}
      \vspace{5 mm}
      \item{Special file .gitignore lists the files that git knows not to track.}
      \vspace{5 mm}
      \item{\code{git status} will warn you about files that are not in category $1$ or $2$.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Three types of git operations}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{Managing the relation between a repository and its associated working directory.}
      \item{Repository maintenance.}
      \item{Managing the relation between two repositories (e.g. between your local repository and a copy that is on the Internet).}

      \item{Tell the repository's index about a new file in the working directory that you want the repository to pay attention to: \code{git add <filename>}.}
      \item{Check-in the (changed) files that are in the working directory, thereby creating a new node: \code{git commit -a}.}
      \item{Using the \code{-a} option with \code{commit} minimizes your interaction with the index. There are alternatives that are more work but that give you more control.}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Repository $\leftrightarrow$ working directory (3)}
  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Use the \code{-m} option to \code{git commit} to provide a `message' that will be associated with the commit.} 
      \item{Example: \code{git commit -a -m `Fixed divide-by-zero error.'}}
      \item{Or omit the \code{-m} in which case a text editor window will open and you can type a longer message.}
      \item{Writing good commit messages itself is an art; see for example \url{https://medium.com/@steveamaza/how-to-write-a-propergit-commit-message-e028865e5791}}

      \item{In this case the merge will fail, and you will have to manually edit D to choose one set of changes or the other (they will both be present in D, with special characters inserted to let you see what is going on). Specialised text editors can be helpful here.}
      \item{At merge time the `level of granularity' is the line (if I amend the start of a line and you amend the end of the same line, then the merge will still fail.) Note that binary files can't be merged.}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{If a node is not `named' (i.e. pointed to by a tag or a branch), and if none of its descendents are named either, then git considers it unneeded and will delete it the next time it does `automatic cleanup'.}

      \item{Begin by cloning repository R1 (to which you don't have write access) to get a new repository R2 (to which you do have write access) \textbf{that is also on GitHub} - this is called forking.}
      \item{Then develop in R2 as usual (this will invloves you cloning R2 to get a local copy R3).}
      \item{Once your work is pushed to R2 you email the owners of R1 to ask them to pull your changes from R2 to R1 (\textit{pull request}).}
